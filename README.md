# Crime-Analysis-Project
The FBI collects these data through the UCR Programâ€™s NIBRS.The data used were from law enforcement agencies submitting 12 months of NIBRS data to the FBI UCR Program for 2012 and were converted and published in CIUS, 2012.

Data cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis:
a. Top 5 states with highest number of Assault offenses registered in all the agency types except cities. (Show pivot of sub-types of Assault offenses)
b. Which category of crimes were most registered in universities?
c. Compare offenses at Michigan State University with offenses at all other universities.
d. Which provinces have state agencies with lowest number of digital offenses registered (Credit Card/Automated Teller Machine Fraud, Wire Fraud)
e. Which category of agency type and their respective agency names have the highest number of offenses registered per million people?
f. Geospatial visualization of the data showing the offence type with highest number of offences in that province (Hint: for each state find the offense type with highest number of offenses and create a geoplot)

Data modelling: 
a. Data: X: Population, Drug/Narcotic Offenses, Drug/Narcotic Violations, Drug Equipment Violations, Theft from Building, Theft from Coin-operated Machine, Theft from Motor Vehicle, Theft of Motor Vehicle Parts or Accessories. Y: Total number of offenses
Task: Implement Linear regression model. Use feature engineering to derive new features from columns in X.
Output: Can linear regression model fit the above data well? What type of linear regression model performs best? Justify your findings.
b. Implement Statistical model of from data available predicting total number of offenses.
